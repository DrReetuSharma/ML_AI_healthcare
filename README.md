# Automated Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Applying ML algorithms in Healthcare

### Introduction
Pneumonia stands as a significant threat, arising from bacterial, viral, or fungal agents. This infection instigates inflammation within the alveoli, crucial air sacs pivotal for gas exchange, causing the accumulation of fluid or pus and hindering respiratory efficacy. Its transmission primarily occurs via airborne droplets dispersed during coughing or sneezing, with additional risk from contact with contaminated surfaces.

Diagnosis often hinges on chest X-ray imaging, a pivotal tool aiding healthcare providers in precisely discerning pneumonia type and severity.

#### Aim of the project
To classify patient chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia cases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

#### Methodology
To classify patient chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia cases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these steps were followed:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of chest X-ray images labeled as normal and pneumonia cases. Ensure the dataset is balanced and of high quality.

2. Data Preprocessing: Resize all images to a uniform size, typically square dimensions like 224x224 pixels. Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.

3. Data Augmentation: Augment the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase diversity and robustness of the model.

4. Model Architecture: Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks. Common architectures include VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. You can also build a custom architecture.

5. Training: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the CNN model on the training set using techniques like transfer learning (using pre-trained models) or training from scratch.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer choice to optimize model performance.

7. Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the validation set to assess accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other metrics. Adjust the model as needed to improve performance.

8. Testing: Finally, test the model on the unseen test set to evaluate its generalization ability. Calculate performance metrics on this set to assess how well the model classifies new, unseen data.

9. Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment where it can classify new chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia cases.

By following these steps and continuously iterating on model improvements, you can build an effective CNN-based classifier for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.
